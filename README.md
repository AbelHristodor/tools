# TOOLS

Some little scripts that make my life just a bit easier and faster made in mostly 
in Python

## Scripts
Currently there are the following scripts:
- *auto_renamer* --> Automatically renames all files in a dir, using the 
configs choosen by the user
- *delete_empty_folder* --> Deletes all empty folders in a master dir
- *backup_db.sh* --> Backups a file in another folder. Has 2 optional parameters. $1 -> file to backup, defaults to 'db.sqlite3'. $2 -> folder to backup to, defaults to 'backup'
