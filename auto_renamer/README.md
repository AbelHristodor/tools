# Auto Renamer
Script that makes possible to rename all files in a given directory.
The user can choose the name and the extension of all files, as well as the format of the name.

Avaiable formats:
- Number_Filename.extension --> 1_track.mp3
- Filename_Number.extension --> track_1.mp3
- FilenameNumber.extension --> track1.mp3

There's also available a .exe file, but i recommend using the python script.

If any errors occur, firstly make sure Windows Defender/Antivirus is not blocking the app.

## For Testing
For testing purposes i also added a populate_dir script that creates a bunch of random files.
